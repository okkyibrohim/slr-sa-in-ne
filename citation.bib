abstract = {In this systematic review, Kitchenhamâ€™s framework is used to explore what tasks, techniques, and benchmarks for Sentiment Analysis have been developed for addressing topics about the natural environment. We comprehensively analyze seven dimensions including contribution, topical focus, data source and query, annotation, language, detail of the task, and technology/algorithm used. By showing how this research area has grown during the last few years, our investigation provides important findings about the results achieved and the challenges that need to be still addressed for making this technology actually helpful for stakeholders such as policymakers and governments.},
