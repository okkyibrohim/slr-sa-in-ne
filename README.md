# Sentiment Analysis for the Natural Environment: a Systematic Review

## About this repository
This repository provides the scraper code for scraping paper metadata and its result including the annotated version for each stage as the complement of our sentiment analysis in the natural environment topics survey paper that has been accepted and will be published in ACM Computing Surveys (https://dl.acm.org/journal/csur).

## About the scraper code and its result
To use the code to scrape and filter paper metadata following the Kitchenham framework as we did in our paper, use the `Python notebook (ipynb)` files in the `code_and_paper_metadata` folder. The flow of using those codes is explained in our paper. For the scraping and filtering result, see the `.xlsx` files in that folder. Before running the code, please install the requirement first, simply run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtual environment. The code provided in this repository is the code we used when we conduct the systematic review paper, which may not efficient in some aspects since at that time our goal is only focused to get and filtering paper metadata following the Kitchenham framework. For the wrapped version and easier to use, please refer to the KitchenScrap repository (https://github.com/okkyibrohim/kitchenscrap).

## About the annotated paper metadata
To see how we annotate the paper metadata for each selection stage following the Kitchenham guideline, please see the `.xlsx` files in the `annotated_paper_metadata` folder. For the stage explanation including its relevant/decision criteria, please read them in our paper.

## More detail
If you want to know more about the flow of using the code and the complete survey paper result, please read them in our paper (the paper link will be given soon once the paper is published in the ACM Computing Surveys journal).
